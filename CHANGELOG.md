# Changelog

All notable changes to Roadplanner will be documented here.

The project follows Semantic Versioning for public releases.

## [Unreleased] — Roadplanner 3.0

### Changed

- Added the Roadplanner repository governance and development handbook.
- Added a single documented specification/patch/validation/merge workflow.
- Added Definition of Done, test strategy, repository structure, commit conventions, release checklist, and publication checklist.
- Strengthened repository validation and release packaging contracts.
- Added a standard pull-request template.
- Licensed Roadplanner under Apache-2.0.
- Added the AI-to-Git patch workflow for iPad and Codespaces.
- Removed the requirement for a repository-specific devcontainer during the initial 3.0 phase.

### Planned

- GitHub and HACS delivery foundation.
- Planning-distance estimates and phase-aware overview.
- Media Intelligence with local deduplication and optional AI highlights.
- Long-conversation compaction and attachment pruning.
- Provider and Roadbook architecture contracts.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Canonical stop ordering shared by Roadbook payloads, maps, day cards, routing, navigation, decisions, assistant context, archives, and imports.
- Automatic destination galleries with up to three planning images per stop.
- Wikimedia Commons coordinate-aware image search and Openverse fallback with source and license metadata.
- Main image selection, reordering, removal, full-screen swipe gallery, lazy loading, and inline retry states.
- Decision slides with up to three images and preference for the stop's own OneDrive travel photos.
- Tolerant structured-output parsing and one bounded Gemini repair attempt for malformed JSON responses.

### Changed

- Stop numbering and derived day routes now use one deterministic ordering contract.
- Existing explicit `position` values remain authoritative; legacy trips fall back to times, start/overnight roles, and stable storage order.
- Destination image providers run concurrently and fail independently.
- Image searches use stop name, category, place, country, coordinates, description, and day context.
- External destination images remain provider-hosted; Roadplanner stores only URLs, attribution, licensing, and selection metadata.

### Fixed

- Maps, stop cards, day flows, routing, navigation, and assistant context no longer disagree about stop order.
- A failed Wikimedia request no longer blocks a stop card, decision template, or alternative image provider.
- Assistant prepare requests can recover from JSON wrapped in Markdown, surrounding prose, a bare list, or a nested JSON string.
- OneDrive image references in persisted decisions are resolved to fresh signed URLs when the panel payload is loaded.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Decision templates can include the currently planned Roadbook stop as a verified baseline option.
- Current-plan decision slides are visibly labelled and require no change-basket transfer.

### Changed

- Markdown links from the assistant tolerate safe line wrapping inside long HTTPS URLs.
- The assistant review button shows a dedicated progress state and opens the handoff overview after preparation.
- Keep-or-replace decisions may contain the current plan plus up to three alternatives.

### Fixed

- Google Maps Markdown links with Unicode query values are rendered as clickable links.
- The "Änderungen prüfen" button no longer fails silently on touch devices.
- A stale "last message unanswered" banner is cleared when a later assistant reply exists.
- Decision questions that mention keeping the existing plan can no longer omit that plan from the options.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Assistant responses can contain safely clickable HTTPS and Google Maps links.
- Persistent, mobile-friendly error dialogs with retry and copy-details actions.
- Visible assistant loading state while requests are processed.

### Changed

- Assistant responses are rendered directly without a blocking full panel reload.
- Decision option enrichment runs concurrently with bounded timeouts.
- Missing images, routes, or geocoding results no longer invalidate an entire decision draft.
- Gemini timeout handling reserves time for a configured fallback model.

### Fixed

- Assistant and decision errors are no longer hidden or clipped at the bottom of mobile screens.

## [2.6.5] — Imported baseline

### Added and stabilized

- Native conversational assistant and change basket.
- Roadbook, routes, stops and inherited overnight starts.
- Routing and Google Maps handoff.
- Documents, expenses and daily tasks.
- Decisions and image-based option cards.
- OneDrive Personal photo synchronization and albums.
- Universal importer.
- Mobile layout and numerous assistant-normalization fixes.

This entry records the first Git-managed baseline. Detailed historical notes are preserved in `docs/legacy/2.6.5/`.
