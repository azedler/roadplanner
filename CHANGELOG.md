# Changelog

All notable changes to Roadplanner will be documented here.

The project follows Semantic Versioning for public releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Canonical location states for every day-route node, including explicit missing, ambiguous and unverified GPS data.
- Review-only “GPS prüfen/ergänzen” workflow that prepares geocoding drafts for incomplete stops without inventing coordinates.
- Complete map legends and partial-route notices that keep GPS-less stops visible in their confirmed sequence.
- Two-stage release automation for Codespaces: prepare, validate, push, pull request, publish, and branch synchronization.
- Protected GitHub release workflow that validates the exact `main` commit, creates a lower-case version tag, publishes release notes from the changelog, and attaches validated manual-install artifacts.
- Canonical Roadplanner validation workflow for pull requests to `main`, with an on-demand manual trigger.

### Changed

- Stop order is independent from schedule times: complete explicit positions win; legacy days preserve their stored user-confirmed list order.
- Every stop mutation and ChangeSet operation leaves a complete gap-free one-based `position` sequence behind.
- The assistant plans stop additions and moves against the complete canonical day sequence and emits explicit positions.
- Local and GitHub release checks now use the same `tools/release.py check` entry point.
- Release preparation cuts the `[Unreleased]` changelog section and keeps `manifest.json` and `const.py` versions synchronized.
- Python caches are removed by release automation before and after tests instead of requiring repetitive manual cleanup.

### Fixed

- A timed ferry can no longer jump ahead of untimed parking, pharmacy, shopping or service stops.
- GPS-less stops no longer disappear silently from the day map; the route remains visibly partial until reviewed coordinates exist.
- GPS repair for an inherited overnight start targets the owning previous Roadbook day instead of creating a duplicate stop.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Canonical day view-model shared by maps, stop cards, schematic day flow, navigation, decisions and assistant context.
- Phase-oriented Roadplanner navigation: Reise, Heute, Erinnerungen and Reisebegleiter.
- Roadplanner 3.0 dashboard with planning progress, open decisions, urgent tasks, visual readiness and the next travel day.
- Deterministic local media curation with duplicate collapse, burst suppression and per-stop/per-day highlights.
- Automatic day covers that prefer personal OneDrive travel photos and fall back to attributed planning images.
- Roadplanner 3.0 Vision & UX Blueprint as the product contract for subsequent work.

### Changed

- Inherited overnight stops are displayed as a shared start marker without renumbering Roadbook-owned stops.
- Legacy `day.start` and `day.end` values remain contextual metadata but no longer appear as pseudo-stops when real stops exist.
- Decision cards prefer locally curated personal travel-photo highlights before external planning images.
- Stop cards show a curated highlight strip while the full OneDrive album remains accessible.
- Technical tools move into a secondary menu so the primary navigation follows the travel lifecycle.

### Fixed

- Map markers, route flow, stop cards, Google Maps handoff and assistant context no longer use divergent day sequences.
- Legacy targets such as a stale `Riga` day-end label no longer appear in the graphical route unless a real Roadbook stop exists.
- Personal-photo duplicates and short bursts no longer dominate stop and day covers.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Canonical stop ordering shared by Roadbook payloads, maps, day cards, routing, navigation, decisions, assistant context, archives, and imports.
- Automatic destination galleries with up to three planning images per stop.
- Wikimedia Commons coordinate-aware image search and Openverse fallback with source and license metadata.
- Main image selection, reordering, removal, full-screen swipe gallery, lazy loading, and inline retry states.
- Decision slides with up to three images and preference for the stop's own OneDrive travel photos.
- Tolerant structured-output parsing and one bounded Gemini repair attempt for malformed JSON responses.

### Changed

- Stop numbering and derived day routes now use one deterministic ordering contract.
- Existing explicit `position` values remain authoritative; legacy trips fall back to times, start/overnight roles, and stable storage order.
- Destination image providers run concurrently and fail independently.
- Image searches use stop name, category, place, country, coordinates, description, and day context.
- External destination images remain provider-hosted; Roadplanner stores only URLs, attribution, licensing, and selection metadata.

### Fixed

- Maps, stop cards, day flows, routing, navigation, and assistant context no longer disagree about stop order.
- A failed Wikimedia request no longer blocks a stop card, decision template, or alternative image provider.
- Assistant prepare requests can recover from JSON wrapped in Markdown, surrounding prose, a bare list, or a nested JSON string.
- OneDrive image references in persisted decisions are resolved to fresh signed URLs when the panel payload is loaded.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Decision templates can include the currently planned Roadbook stop as a verified baseline option.
- Current-plan decision slides are visibly labelled and require no change-basket transfer.

### Changed

- Markdown links from the assistant tolerate safe line wrapping inside long HTTPS URLs.
- The assistant review button shows a dedicated progress state and opens the handoff overview after preparation.
- Keep-or-replace decisions may contain the current plan plus up to three alternatives.

### Fixed

- Google Maps Markdown links with Unicode query values are rendered as clickable links.
- The "Änderungen prüfen" button no longer fails silently on touch devices.
- A stale "last message unanswered" banner is cleared when a later assistant reply exists.
- Decision questions that mention keeping the existing plan can no longer omit that plan from the options.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Assistant responses can contain safely clickable HTTPS and Google Maps links.
- Persistent, mobile-friendly error dialogs with retry and copy-details actions.
- Visible assistant loading state while requests are processed.

### Changed

- Assistant responses are rendered directly without a blocking full panel reload.
- Decision option enrichment runs concurrently with bounded timeouts.
- Missing images, routes, or geocoding results no longer invalidate an entire decision draft.
- Gemini timeout handling reserves time for a configured fallback model.

### Fixed

- Assistant and decision errors are no longer hidden or clipped at the bottom of mobile screens.

## [2.6.5] — Imported baseline

### Added and stabilized

- Native conversational assistant and change basket.
- Roadbook, routes, stops and inherited overnight starts.
- Routing and Google Maps handoff.
- Documents, expenses and daily tasks.
- Decisions and image-based option cards.
- OneDrive Personal photo synchronization and albums.
- Universal importer.
- Mobile layout and numerous assistant-normalization fixes.

This entry records the first Git-managed baseline. Detailed historical notes are preserved in `docs/legacy/2.6.5/`.
